### ‚ùì What is meaning checking currency?
Service sends the GET request on Open Exchanger API 
and checks the rate of currency in relation to ruble. <br>
After that service checks the difference between today and yesterday's values.
### ‚ùì What the gif is returning?

Service sends the GET request on Giphy API and can return 2 types of gifs:
- Rich gif. This is gifs which user search when type "Rich"
- Broke gif. This is gifs which user search when type "Broke"

If the value of currency today in more than yesterday, you will get Rich gif. <br>
Otherwise Broke gif (cause if even the today's value is the same as yesterday, you will not earn any money and only waste time, and time is money haha)
